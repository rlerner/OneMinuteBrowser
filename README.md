# OneMinuteBrowser
Ever curious about a link, wondering if it will contain malware? Wish you had a machine that you could use to click dangerous links without affecting your machine?

Within 60 seconds (I actually timed this on my laptop, yo), you can spin up a virtual machine and try Xubuntu (or any other flavor).

What you'll need:
 - A machine running bash and VirtualBox. This script won't work without it.
 - An ISO of the distro you want to use.
 
Have that? Great.

#chmod +x saferbrowser.sh
#./saferbrowser.sh

Once that comes up, hit "Try Xubuntu", and then open a browser. 60 seconds later, you have a throwaway machine with no disk and minimal system requirements.
